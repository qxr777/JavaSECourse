A simple address-book implementation.

How to start this project:
    Either: Create an AddressBook object and add
    contact details (such as name, address, and phone) to it.
    Or: create an AddressBookDemo and use its getBook method.

Create an AddressBookFileHandler to illustrate some basic
input-output operations on an AddressBook.

User instructions:
    + Search results are saved to "results.txt" in the project folder.
    + The file "sample.txt", in the project, folder contains a sample
      entry that can be added, using the addEntriesFromFile of
      the AddressBookFileHandler.
    + A complete address book object may be saved, in binary form,
      using the saveToFile method. This may be read in again with
      readFromFile.
