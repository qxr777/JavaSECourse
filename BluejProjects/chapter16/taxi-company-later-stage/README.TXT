This project provides a partial implementation of a simulation of
taxis operating on a city grid to pick up and transport passengers.
    
This is the fourth stage of this project. It illustrates the 
implementation of operation with multiple taxis.

How to start this project:
    Create a Simulation object and invoke its run method.

Use this version to explore further development ideas, such
as implementation of the Shuttle class.
